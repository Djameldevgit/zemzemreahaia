  "badgeArtista": "Visual artist",
  "badgeDesarrollador": "MERN developer",
  "introduccionTitulo": "My creative space",
  "introduccionTexto": "This space was created specifically to showcase my journey as a visual artist and MERN developer. Two deep passions that have accompanied me for many years and that I wouldn't trade for all the treasures in the world.",
  "tituloTrayectoria": "My artistic trajectory",
  "trayectoria1": "Like many artists whose talents emerged from childhood, I trained as a portrait artist in Barcelona where I spent 17 years drawing portraits and living from my art, achieving great success during those years.",
  "trayectoria2": "After returning to my country, Algeria, I continued my artistic path where I organized art exhibitions and received several awards including the 'Artist Card'.",
  "premio": "Winner of the 'Artist Card' award and recognition in local exhibitions",
  "dualidadTitulo": "Uniting two passions",
  "dualidadDescripcion": "To this day, I continue to dedicate my time to two fundamental passions in my life: painting and programming. It's not easy to balance two talents that require all the time and effort, but I have achieved deep knowledge in both fields.",
  "motivacionTitulo": "The motivation behind creating the platform",
  "motivacion1": "I spent years publishing my works on social media, but I understood that these platforms are not designed to buy and sell art. They are designed for continuous entertainment with games, live streams and chats, not for focusing on artistic publication.",
  "motivacion2": "I also noticed that local groups rejected publishing my paintings for unclear reasons, while allowing works generated with artificial intelligence. Most of the public cannot distinguish between the work of a real artist and one generated by AI at times.",
  "motivacion3": "The administrators didn't care about protecting authentic human art, their only concern was increasing the number of subscribers. This situation was leading my art to a dead end.",
  "solucionTitulo": "The technical solution",
  "solucionTexto": "I decided to study and explore programming in depth, using artificial intelligence, especially ChatGPT, working days and nights between painting and programming. I divided my time between perfecting my artistic talent and learning Express, sockets, authentication, Google APIs, and everything necessary to create an application where I can not only publish my works, but also provide the opportunity to other artists of different categories.",
  "solucionTexto2": "This application doesn't seek to compete with anyone; it's a personal challenge and an evolving project. Every day I paint to improve my art and program to improve the user experience.",
  "visionTitulo": "My vision for the future",
  "visionDescripcion": "My goal is to develop this platform to reach a wider scope, and become a refuge for authentic art and real talents in a world where artificial intelligence increasingly dominates the creative landscape.",
  "visionFinal": "I'm open to other MERN developers joining to expand this project more and more, because we don't know what possibilities the future may hold for this ambitious project.",
